      <h1>Repetition</h1>
      <p>
When I was introduced to web site design it was with raw HTML files or 
near enough and a bit of CSS.  The repetition was the very opposite of 
what I had learnt from programming. Most of the different pages was 
shared HTML tags in the very same order, and saving repeating the css 
styles didn’t seem to do much about repeating HTML. I ended up not 
minding CSS but not liking HTML at all.
      </p>
      <p>
Fast forward a few years and I’m designing websites using Sinatra with 
Ruby, and I get a glimpse of how nesting erb files can finally do away 
with all the repeated HTML blocks. Finally it made sense, you produce 
the HTML file for the client but never look at it unless you need to 
debug something in the browser’s tools. You focus on designing bits of 
HTML and using a little scripting in places such as to convert data to 
list items.
      </p>
      <p>
Of course as I’m hosting these webpages on github.io I don’t actually 
have a proper server to respond to requests and generate the pages on 
demand, but that doesn’t matter. The end user’s browser just needs to 
see the HTML file; I can develop it using Sinatra and then just save the
 HTML files myself to put the static files onto Github for people to 
actually browse.
      </p>
      <p>
So that’s what I’ve done.
