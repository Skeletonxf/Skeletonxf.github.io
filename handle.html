    <h1>My username</h1>

<p class = "article-date">2022/06/26</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the same username more or less for as long as I&rsquo;ve been using accounts. Occasionally I get questions so this is a quick rundown of my username.</p>

<h2>Lego</h2>

<p>Long before I picked up any coding I was playing with Lego, and some time ago I was signing up a Lego account. I forget why exactly, but one thing I do remember is you got to customise a Lego figure as well as choose your username. It may not come as a surprise that I choose a skeleton figure. The <code>xf</code> comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Exo-Force">Exo-Force</a>, a long discontinued Lego theme. I still fondly remember playing some of those old Flash games on the Lego website with characters I unlocked from the codes in the sets I had. Unfortunately they disappeared from the web before I ever thought to download them or found archives. I suppose I&rsquo;d have difficulty playing those <code>.swf</code> files nowadays even if I had kept a copy.</p>

<h2>Games</h2>

<p>I tried to branch out a little when picking usernames for online games. I opted for <code>Skeletonwarlord</code> in a few places, emphasising the waves of undead under my control. Skeletonxf was never taken though, probably because of the two seemingly random letters on the end; gradually I choose the convenient path of just reusing the same handle everywhere.</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve been able to get a taste of many different areas of coding. From university I tried out web development, Android development, low level code, machine learning, lots of Java projects, the list goes on. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m experienced in most of those, but I got to try them. There&rsquo;s still many areas that I&rsquo;ve little to no experience in, but I&rsquo;ve shown myself repeatedly that I can pickup new languages and domains easily. I&rsquo;ve gradually started to think of my username in another sense of &lsquo;skeleton crew&rsquo; as well.</p>
