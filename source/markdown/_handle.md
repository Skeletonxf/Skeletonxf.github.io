# My username
<p class = "article-date">2022/06/26</p>

I've been using the same username more or less for as long as I've been using accounts. Occasionally I get questions so this is a quick rundown of my username.

## Lego

Long before I picked up any coding I was playing with Lego, and some time ago I was signing up a Lego account. I forget why exactly, but one thing I do remember is you got to customise a Lego figure as well as choose your username. It may not come as a surprise that I choose a skeleton figure. The `xf` comes from [Exo-Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Exo-Force), a long discontinued Lego theme. I still fondly remember playing some of those old Flash games on the Lego website with characters I unlocked from the codes in the sets I had. Unfortunately they disappeared from the web before I ever thought to download them or found archives. I suppose I'd have difficulty playing those `.swf` files nowadays even if I had kept a copy.

## Games

I tried to branch out a little when picking usernames for online games. I opted for `Skeletonwarlord` in a few places, emphasising the waves of undead under my control. Skeletonxf was never taken though, probably because of the two seemingly random letters on the end; gradually I choose the convenient path of just reusing the same handle everywhere.

## Coding

Over the years I've been able to get a taste of many different areas of coding. From university I tried out web development, Android development, low level code, machine learning, lots of Java projects, the list goes on. I can't say I'm experienced in most of those, but I got to try them. There's still many areas that I've little to no experience in, but I've shown myself repeatedly that I can pickup new languages and domains easily. I've gradually started to think of my username in another sense of 'skeleton crew' as well.
