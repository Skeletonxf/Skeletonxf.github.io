## The results

The level 1 point buy rogue will already make more profit from DC 15 than DC 10, though the variance will be much higher since DC 10 is already nearly impossible to fail outright. As they get ability score increases at level 4 and 8, and proficiency increases to +3 at level 5 and +4 at level 9, with expertise making that +6 and +8 respectively, the rogue can eventually max out their dexterity for +5 DEX +4 PROF +4 EXP at level 9. This could in the most generous optimisation case mean +13 to stealth and thieves' tools. At level 6 the rogue also gets to choose 2 more expertise skills so the perception might not be too far behind +13 either.

If we consider rolling stats instead of point buy and say the rogue gets to 20 dexterity, 20 wisdom, and puts expertise in all three ability checks, then at level 6 they're adding 11 to all three checks and 13 at level 9.

This gets them to the DC 20 crime being somewhat profitable, with an expected value around 83 gp and failure slightly less than 3%. DC 10 became a free 25 gp a long time ago and DC 15 offers a more modest 67.5 gp expected value with failure only possible if they roll three 1s.

Proficiency bonuses eventually go up to +6 so it's possible for a high level rogue to have +17 in all three of these checks, but by that point petty theft is probably the least of their concerns.

The final piece of the puzzle is the reliable talent class feature for level 11 rogues. This allows a rogue proficient in all three checks to treat any rolls between 1 and 9 as 10 instead, massively reducing the variance of their rolls and potentially removing the chance of failure.
