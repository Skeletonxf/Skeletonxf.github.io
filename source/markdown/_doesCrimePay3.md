## Reliable talent

Perhaps a little counter intuitively reliable talent is better at things you expected to be able to pass at anyway than things you were struggling to achieve. This is because if you *need* to roll 11 or higher for success, turning a 1 into a 10 is still a failure so doesn't improve your chances.

On the DC 20 crime, this creates a massive breakpoint where getting each ability modifier from +9 to +10 removes the possibility of failure entirely, turning a 50/50 success on 11+/20 into guaranteed success.

The DC 25 check remains stubbornly difficult however, since reliable talent doesn't kick in until you get a modifier higher enough to auto pass.

At level 13 the rogue gets a proficiency bonus of +5 which with expertise and maxed ability score comes out to +15. This is where we finally hit the breakpoint in the DC 25 checks, each ability check we can get to +15 massively increases our expected value by turning into an automatic pass.

## Other modifiers

I've ignored all the additional dice modifiers such as casting Guidance on yourself for a +1d4 or using various resource based ability check boosts such as +1d6 Knowledge from a Past Life for reborn characters. If you're allowed to use these extra dice modifiers in downtime, that +15 needed to auto-pass the DC 25 checks starts to drop, and reliable talent kicks in even when by itself it wouldn't create success, since rolling a 1 on a d20 when you needed 13 or higher to pass is still 50/50 odds if you're adding a d4 to that 10.
Giving yourself advantage on these checks by itself doesn't make reliable talent kick in, but it also skews the probability distribution in your favour.

## Summary

It doesn't look like crime will pay that well for most rogues till level 15. One consolation is that getting your modifiers past 15 doesn't increase your profit at all once you have reliable talent on all of the checks. Without expertise that DC 25 crime is going to lose you a lot of money (unless you can use add additional dice on top of your d20 rolls), and even with expertise, you'll need a lot of levels to get your proficiency and expertise modifiers high enough for it to pay better than the DC 20 crime.

Consider fighting in the pits for honest money instead, you can't lose money there and if you're lucky you can make 200 gp in profit - no need to rob of the richest figures in town for a slim chance at making off with more than 200 gp.

Of course, don't let the math stop you, it might be a bad financial idea to steal from very rich people but that need not stop your character wanting to try anyway.
